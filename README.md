# CONFIGURATION IDE IAR EMBEDDED : Follow these steps to configure project options
1. In the Project Editor, right-click on the project name and select Options... to display the Options dialog box:
In the Options dialog box, select the General Options category, open the Target tab and select Device - ST -STM32F303:

2. If your source files include header files, select the C/C++ Compiler category, open the Preprocessor tab, and specify their paths. The path of the
include directory is a relative path. In this project, the library to include is stored in path /libraries/ as shown:

3. To set up the ST-Link embedded debug tool interface, select the Debugger category, open the Setup tab and, from the drop-down Driver menu, select ST-Link. Then,
open the Debugger tab and select Use flash loader(s):

5. Done: click OK to save the project settings.

6. For this project, the workspace has been saved in the "binary_counter" folder and is renamed "workspace_project".

# Description
## Project binary counter
To make a binary counter we need a counter variable, whose value increases by 1 each time the USER button (PA0) is pressed. 
We also want the value to be shown on the display, which in our case is represented by the 8 LEDs.

Example:

- cnt = 1 -> blue led PE8 on
- cnt = 2 -> red led PE9 on
- cnt = 3 -> blue and red led (PE8 and PE9) on

## Project LED FLASHING EVERY x SECONDS
The clock frequency provided by the board is 8 MHz, which is 8 million counts per second. 
For example, if we want the LEDs to change state every 0.5 second, the counter must reach 4 million.

fck = 8 MHz

Tck = 1 / fck = 125 ns

N = Î”t / Tck = 4 000 000

## Project EXTERNAL INTERRUPT (PA0)
Management external interrupt when PA0 is pressed.
For this project, is added a new c source file (stm32f3x_api.c)


## Project INTERNAL INTERRUPT (TIMER3)
For this project, is added a new c source file (stm32f3x_api.c)
Management INTERNAL interrupt WITH LED ON / OFF EVERY SECOND. 
Inasmuch as TIM3 is a 16-bit timer, it can count to 65,535 before rolling over, which means we can measure events no longer than about 819 microseconds if Fck = 80 MHz!

If we wish to measure longer events, we need to use a prescaler, which is a piece of hardware that divides the clock source. 
For example, a prescaler of 80 would turn an 80 MHz clock into a 1 MHz clock.
