2. If your source files include header files, select the C/C++ Compiler category, open the Preprocessor tab, and specify their paths. The path of the
include directory is a relative path. In this project, the library to include is stored in path /Library/ as shown:

3. To set up the ST-Link embedded debug tool interface, select the Debugger category, open the Setup tab and, from the drop-down Driver menu, select ST-Link. Then,
open the Debugger tab and select Use flash loader(s):

# Description
## Project binary counter
To make a binary counter we need a counter variable, whose value increases by 1 each time the USER button (PA0) is pressed. 
We also want the value to be shown on the display, which in our case is represented by the 8 LEDs.

Example:

- cnt = 1 -> blue led PE8 on
- cnt = 2 -> red led PE9 on
- cnt = 3 -> blue and red led (PE8 and PE9) on

## Project LED FLASHING EVERY x SECONDS
The clock frequency provided by the board is 8 MHz, which is 8 million counts per second. 
For example, if we want the LEDs to change state every 0.5 second, the counter must reach 4 million.
fck = 8 MHz
Tck = 1 / fck = 125 ns
N = Î”t / Tck = 4 000 000
